# Automatic-Attendance-Monitoring-System
"Automatic Attendance Monitoring System"  To maintain the attendance record in schools colleges or any administrative sector through a conventional method by calling the name of every person is very difficult and time-consuming and even a chance of proxy attendance so the following system is based on face recognition to maintain the attendance record of the students and workers.  In our implementation, we have tried to recognize faces and marking down the attendance using Haar Cascades with the 'Local Binary Pattern Histogram' technique. The graphic user interface is designed using the Tkinter library.  This monitoring system gives the appropriate tracking of the students attending the schools/ colleges with real-time data stored in a separate file.   On the contrary, this is an offline system which is the only limitation for this system.  Picture Description: 1. Tkinter GUI of the system -  2. Face recognized using this system -  3. Record stored in real-time
